Inspired by [SamarpanCoder2002](https://github.com/SamarpanCoder2002), **Tic-Tac-Toe AI** is a simple desktop application built with Python and Tkinter that lets you play against a pre-programmed AI opponent. The game combines an interactive GUI with turn-based strategy powered by AI logic. The project aims to explore basic AI patterns in classic games and implement reactive decision-making without external libraries.

## Features
- Intelligent AI opponent with hardcoded prediction and response strategy.
- GUI powered by Tkinter with a dark theme aesthetic.
- Two game modes:
- Human vs Machine
- Machine vs Human (AI starts first)
- Reset and game-over handling with message popups.
- Clean modular structure (single class encapsulation).


## Getting Started

### Requirements:
- [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) (comes bundled with most Python distributions on Windows)

### Run the Game:
- `python tic_tac_toe_ai.py`
